# Get-Schwifty
Rotating Circle.
Increasing number of balls bouncing around in the circle.
Every even level 1 more ball, every odd level they speed up.
A goal and a gate.
If a ball goes in the gate it's game over.
If all the balls go into the goal it goes to the next level.
Save the highest level as a highscore.
